# ProgramingFundamentals
Programming fundamentals are the basic concepts and principles underlying software creation. Some of the most important include:

## Algorithms
A set of step-by-step instructions for solving a problem or performing a task.

## Data Structures
Ways to organize and store data so that it can be used efficiently (like lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs).

## Conditionals
Statements that allow the program to make decisions based on conditions (if, else, etc.).

## Loops
Mechanisms to repeat a sequence of instructions (for, while).

## Functions/Methods
Reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task and can be called from different parts of the program.

## Variables and Data Types
Named storage spaces with specific types that hold values.

## Input/Output (I/O)
Mechanisms to receive data from outside the program and send data out.

## Programming Paradigms
Styles and approaches to solving problems (like structured programming, object-oriented, functional, etc.
